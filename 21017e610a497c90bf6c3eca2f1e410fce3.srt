00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
My dear one, there are seasons when everything around you feels uncertain.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,160
Plans shift, answers feel delayed, and the ground beneath you no longer feels as solid as it once did.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,720
In moments like these, it is easy to feel anxious or afraid.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,200
But remember this truth. Even when life feels unstable, God is holding you steady.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,880
The Bible reminds us that God is our refuge and strength,

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,840
and ever-present help in times of trouble.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,080
That means when things feel shaky, you are not unsupported.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,560
You may not feel strong right now, but you are being upheld by a strength greater than your own.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,800
God's hands do not tremble, even when your heart does.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,200
You might be questioning why this season feels so unpredictable,

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
why familiar things no longer feel secure,

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
but Scripture tells us that God orders the steps of the righteous,

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,440
even when you do not understand the direction he is guiding you with purpose.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,080
What feels like uncertainty may actually be God gently repositioning you for something better.

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,680
There are moments when holding on requires intentional faith.

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,720
Choosing to fill your mind with truth instead of fear makes a difference.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,120
When you stay connected to reminders of God's promises and surround yourself with faith-filled encouragement,

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,040
your heart becomes steadier. Peace grows where faith is continually fed.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,160
If you desire blessings, clarity, and consistent spiritual strength,

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,560
it matters how you nurture your faith.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,800
Staying connected to messages that draw you closer to God

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,760
and keep your focus on His Word allows your spirit to remain anchored even when circumstances change.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,800
For those seeking that steady encouragement and spiritual nourishment,

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,720
being part of the channel membership can help keep your faith rooted

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,680
and your heart aligned with God's promises.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
The Bible says that those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion,

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,760
which cannot be shaken.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,800
As you continue to trust Him, expect stability to return to your heart,

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,520
even if everything around you has not yet settled.

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
God is teaching you how to stand firm without needing to control everything.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,760
Release the need to have all the answers right now.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Rest in the truth that God is holding you, guiding you, and strengthening you day by day.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,720
You are not losing ground. You are learning to stand on faith.

34
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,960
Stay anchored, stay connected, and trust that God will steady every step you take.
